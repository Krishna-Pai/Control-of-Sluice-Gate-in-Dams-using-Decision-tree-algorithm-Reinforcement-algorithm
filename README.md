# Control-of-Sluice-Gate-in-Dams-using-Decision-tree-algorithm-Reinforcement-algorithm
Sep 2018 – Mar 2019

## Project Description:
An automated system to control the Sluice gates in dams using Artificial Intelligence. As rainfall is very difficult to predict, the water level in the dam’s reservoir gets affected. If the water level increases drastically due to heavy rainfall it results in floods. By introducing this predictive models and statistical analysis, it is possible to predetermine the heavy rainfall conditions, hence control the water level in the reservoir in advance and also generate the power.
